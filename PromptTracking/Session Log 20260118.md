## Sample Prompt History (2026-01-18 17:01:09)
- This sample was produced to demonstrate how to get started with VS Code, Copilot, Claude Haiku 4.5, Python, and ProjectTracking for an alpha tester who is new to VS Code. 
1. The following prompt was typed into VS Code with the GitHub Copilot extension enabled.
- The prompt was then executed by GitHub Copilot within VS Code. (some extensions may have been involved)
- It was then captured into this log file by right clicking the displayed prompt, selecting Copy, and then typing `logp` in the PowerShell terminal.
- The response from Copilot was captured and saved in this ProjectTracking log by right clicking the displayed response, selecting Copy, and then typing `logr` in the PowerShell terminal.

<!--Start Prompt-->
# Getting started with VS Code
- Please help me get my alpha tester, who has barely heard of VS Code, get started with using copilot, Claude Haiku 4.5, python and ProjectTracking. 

## Goal
1. Help my friend to start using VS Code and Copilot to start doing agentic workflows. 

## Assumptions
1. He uses and likes python
2. He is experienced with powershell
3. He is using Perplexity (free tier I think) for Research daily.
4. Part of his research is in the area of health care and how to use AI to mazimize his success with his doctor. And it is working.
5. He is a Windows 11 user.
6. He also uses Comet and Edge on both his Android phone and Windows 11.
7. I do not know if he knows markdown. We did not discuss it. But it would not be amiss to acknowledge that chatbots generally return markdown in their responses.
8. A discussion of useful extensions and how to install them into his freshly installed VS Code would be nice.

## Expected output.
1. A structured markdown file in the current folder I can then email to my alpha tester to get him started. 
2. You can put it in the current folder. "G:\repos\PromptTrackingRepo".  I will move it into an email and send it to him. 
3. The tone can be like we are talking to a friend who is knowlegable, world wise, and likes AI as much as I do. We are giving him some next steps to enhance his use of AI.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive getting-started guide for your alpha tester. Here's what I included:

## 📋 Guide Contents

**Getting-Started-with-VS-Code-and-AI.md** includes:

1. **Landscape Overview** - What they're about to use and why
2. **VS Code Installation** - Step-by-step setup
3. **GitHub Copilot Setup** - Getting access and integration
4. **Claude Integration** - How to use it alongside VS Code
5. **Python Setup** - Creating projects, virtual environments, running code
6. **ProjectTracking Integration** - How to log their AI workflow
7. **Essential Extensions** - 8 must-have extensions with explanations
8. **Markdown Basics** - Since chatbots return markdown
9. **First Agentic Workflow** - A realistic healthcare scenario
10. **Daily Shortcuts** - Keyboard tricks they'll use constantly

14. **Philosophy** - Why this workflow is powerful for their research

## 🎯 Tone & Approach

- Written as if talking to a capable friend, not condescending
- Acknowledges his PowerShell expertise and Python knowledge

- Practical examples he can immediately use
- Friendly, encouraging language throughout

The file is ready to email! It's in the PromptTracking repo folder as Getting-Started-with-VS-Code-and-AI.md. Your friend should have everything needed to go from "barely heard of VS Code" to running agentic workflows with Claude, Copilot, Python, and ProjectTracking. 🚀
