Roger, 
I did not forget about you. I was updating the github repository for you.

Go to https://github.com/bizcad/PromptTracking


1. Click the green button and download the zip file. It should go to your Downloads folder.

2. Unzip it to a place you can work with it. I put it in a "repos" directory. 
- One common place is in "C:\Users\{yourusername}\source\repos\".

3. I do not know how you organize your research.
- for me everything is code and is save it to github, so repos is where it goes.
- for you, you can just unzip it to your Downloads folder and it will extract to a subdirectory Downloads\PromptTracking\.
- in the top level directory are two meaningful files.

README.md (the file which displays on the main page of the repo)
Getting-Started-with-VS-Code-and-AI.md (a detailed explanation of how to use it in VS Code. Read Part 1.

- They are both markdown files. You can read them in the Github repo.

4. PromptTracking directory into the root of your Project folder where ever that is.

Text me with questions.
