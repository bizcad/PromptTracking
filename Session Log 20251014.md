# Session Log 2025-10-14


## How session logging works (2025-10-14 09:25:10)
I'll create a comprehensive installation guide for general use with ChatGPT projects. 

Created [](file:///g%3A/repos/QuestionManager/PromptTracking/Installation%20Guide.md)

I've created a comprehensive installation guide that covers:

## **Key Features of the Installation Guide:**

1. **Prerequisites Section** - Complete PowerShell installation instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Step-by-Step Installation** - Clear commands for both Command Prompt and PowerShell
3. **Directory Structure** - Shows exactly what the extracted files should look like
4. **Security Setup** - PowerShell execution policy configuration
5. **Testing Instructions** - How to verify the system works
6. **Documentation References** - Points users to the README and technical details
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions
8. **Permanent Setup** - How to make aliases available in all PowerShell sessions

## **Example Commands Included:**
- Directory creation in both CMD and PowerShell
- Navigation commands for both environments  
- PowerShell profile configuration
- Quick reference for all logging commands

The guide is designed to be self-contained and suitable for sharing with anyone who wants to use the session logging system with their ChatGPT projects. It assumes no prior PowerShell knowledge and provides clear examples for common scenarios like the "Parkinsons Research" project you mentioned.

The file is ready to be included in any `ProjectTracking.zip` distribution package!

Made changes.
